I do not take credit for the designing of this template!

## What is it?

Grayscale Press is a WordPress reworking of [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) & [Grayscale SASS](https://github.com/blackfyre/grayscale-sass), a multipurpose, one page HTML theme for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) created by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/). It is designed to be a rapid-fire solution to a landing page for your WP installation. It is meant to stand oustide your theme, acting as a special-cases page for events, promotions, etc. It's also made to look bloody good, of course!

The template itself uses Gulp, Bower and SCSS for development. You do not need to use these things, if you want to work out of the box. If you want to do some customization, it should be easier thanks to the extras! 

## Getting Started

To use this template, choose one of the following options to get started:

0. (required once if not already installed) Install bower(`npm install -g bower`), node dependencies(`npm install`) sass (`gem install sass`)
1. Fork/download this repository on GitHub
2. Install bower dependencies (`bower update`)
3. Use Gulp to compile/update
4. Modify template to meet specific design / component needs
5. Upload directly to `Plugins` directory within `wp-content`
6. Add widget areas and enjoy!
